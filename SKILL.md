description: "B2B lead prospecting and outreach via the Okki Go platform. Use this skill to (1) search global companies, (2) find decision-maker contact emails, (3) send cold outreach emails/EDM, (4) check email delivery status, (5) check credits/quota balance, or (6) upgrade plans/buy credits. Do NOT trigger if the user wants to search ON a DIFFERENT platform (e.g. 'search 1688 for suppliers', 'find products on Alibaba'). Having a product listing on another platform is fine — only skip when the search action itself targets another platform. Also NOT for: reading incoming emails, CRM management, or account settings."

## Authentication & API Key Setup

All endpoints use API Key authentication. Each user has an independent `sk-` prefixed key. Request header format:

```
Authorization: ApiKey $OKKIGO_API_KEY
X-Hostname: xxx
```

### First-use check

Before the first API call in each session, check if the key is configured:

```bash
[ -z "$OKKIGO_API_KEY" ] && echo "NO_KEY" || echo "KEY_SET"
```

- **`KEY_SET`** → Proceed directly with the user's request
- **`NO_KEY`** → Follow the email verification flow below

If `NO_KEY` but the user has explicitly provided an API Key in context, save it directly. See saving instructions below.

### Email Verification to Obtain API Key

1. Ask the user for their email address
2. Send verification code:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "${OKKIGO_BASE_URL:-https://go.okki.ai}/api/v1/auth/register-email" \
  ${HOSTNAME:+-H "X-Hostname: $HOSTNAME"} \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"<user email>"}' | jq '.'
```

3. After the user provides the 6-digit code, exchange it for an API Key:

```bash
curl -s -X POST "${OKKIGO_BASE_URL:-https://go.okki.ai}/api/v1/auth/verify-email" \
  ${HOSTNAME:+-H "X-Hostname: $HOSTNAME"} \
  -H "X-OpenClaw-Provision-Api-Key: true" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"email":"<user_email>","code":"<6_digit_code>"}' | jq '.'
```

4. Persist the API Key (**required, once only**):

After obtaining the `apiKey`, **you must inform the user** that the Agent is about to run the following command to persist the configuration, and **ask for explicit consent** before executing:

```
I'm about to run the following command to save your API Key to the okki go skill config:
`openclaw config set skills.entries.okkigo.apiKey "sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"`
Do you approve?
```

After user approval, execute:

```bash
openclaw config set skills.entries.okkigo.apiKey "sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
```

If the command fails, show this message once for manual execution:

> Your API Key: sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
> Please run this command immediately to save it — this key is shown only once.
> `openclaw config set skills.entries.okkigo.apiKey "sk-xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"`

Once saved, OpenClaw auto-injects it as `OKKIGO_API_KEY` in future sessions — no re-verification needed.

## Billing Confirmation Rules

These rules protect users from being charged unknowingly. **All workflows must follow them.**

### Rule 1: Confirm before implicit paid API calls

"Implicit" means the user didn't explicitly ask for details/emails, but the Agent decides to call `profile` or `profileEmails` on its own. In this case, confirm first:

> I found some matching companies. Viewing a company's full details or contact emails costs 1 credit per company (free if viewed within the last 30 days). Shall I proceed?

**Exception (no confirmation needed):** If the user explicitly said "get details", "show company info", "find emails", "get contacts", etc., treat it as an active request and call directly.

### Rule 2: Report charges after every paid API call

After each successful paid API call, include the cost summary at the end of your response:

> This query used 1 credit. Remaining balance: XX (monthly) + YY (add-on).

For multiple companies:

> This batch queried 3 companies, using 2 credits (1 was a repeat within 30 days — no charge). Remaining: XX.

If unsure about the balance, call `GET /api/v1/credit/balance` after the paid call to get the latest numbers.

### Rule 3: First-session confirmation for contact search

Before the **first** call to `POST /contacts/search` in the current session, regardless of whether the user explicitly asked, inform and confirm:

> Contact search costs 1 credit per query. Proceed with the search?

After confirmation, subsequent calls in the same session do not need re-confirmation.

## Output Formatting

Present API results in user-friendly format, not raw JSON.

### Company search results

Show key info in a table for quick scanning:

| # | Company | Country | Industry | Website |
|---|---------|---------|----------|---------|
| 1 | TechCorp GmbH | Germany | Electronics | techcorp.de |
| 2 | ElekTech AG | Germany | Electronics | elektech.com |

- For 10+ results, show the first 10, state the total, and offer "say 'next page' to see more"
- For zero results, suggest broadening criteria (different keywords, removing country filter, etc.)

### Contact information

| Name | Title | Email | LinkedIn |
|------|-------|-------|----------|
| Hans Mueller | Procurement Manager | hans@techcorp.de | Yes |
| Lisa Schmidt | CEO | — | Yes |

### Balance information

> **Current Account Balance**
> - Search credits: 80 (monthly) + 400 (add-on) = **480 available**
> - EDM quota: 200 (monthly) + 2000 (add-on) = **2200 available**
> - Monthly quota resets: 2026-04-30

### Email send feedback

After sending:

> Submitted 2 emails (task ID: 1001), status: pending
> Emails are sent asynchronously — actual delivery takes seconds to minutes. Let me know if you'd like to check status later.

When checking status:

> **Task 1001 results**: 48 sent / 2 failed / 50 total
> Failed: bob@globex.com — Invalid email address

## Workflow Orchestration

User requests often span multiple workflows. The Agent needs to understand when to chain steps and when to pause for user decisions.

### Workflow A: Exploration — "Help me find target customers"

1. **Search companies** (free, see [api-reference.md §2](./references/api-reference.md#2-搜索公司)) → display results table
2. **Wait for user to select** companies of interest → do NOT proactively call paid APIs
3. User selects → **Get contact emails** (follow Billing Rule 1 before calling, see [api-reference.md §4](./references/api-reference.md#4-获取公司联系人邮件))
4. Display contacts → ask if they want to send outreach

### Workflow B: Contact Search — "Find a specific person"

- Use `POST /contacts/search` to search by name, title, email, or company (see [api-reference.md §5](./references/api-reference.md#5-搜索联系人))
- Follow Billing Rule 3 (first-session confirmation)
- Supports filtering by country, has_email, employee count, etc.

### Workflow C: Precision — "Send outreach to procurement managers in German auto parts companies"

1. Search companies → display results for user confirmation
2. Get contacts (confirm billing) → filter by relevant titles
3. Display contact list → **ask user to confirm recipients and email content**
4. **Never send emails before user confirms** — use `POST /emails/send/batch` for same-template sends (see [api-reference.md §6](./references/api-reference.md#6-发送批量开发信))

### Workflow D: Personalized Outreach — "Send each company a tailored email"

- Same flow as Workflow C, but use `POST /emails/send/personalized` for unique content per recipient (see [api-reference.md §7](./references/api-reference.md#7-发送个性化开发信))
- Each email should reference the recipient's company/industry context

### Workflow E: Check Balance

- Call `GET /api/v1/credit/balance` (free, see [api-reference.md §1](./references/api-reference.md#1-查询积分与-edm-余额))
- Display using the balance format from Output Formatting section
- If quota is low, direct user to [go.okki.ai/pricing](https://go.okki.ai/pricing)

### Workflow F: Check Email Status — "How did my last batch go?"

- Only call when user asks ("did they send?", "which ones failed?") — do NOT proactively poll
- Use `GET /emails/tasks` for task list, `GET /emails/tasks/:taskId` for details (see [api-reference.md §8-11](./references/api-reference.md#8-查询邮件任务列表))
- Task status flow: `pending` → `requested` → `completed` / `partial` / `failed`

### Core Principles

- **Free operations can be executed proactively**: search companies, check balance, check email status
- **Paid operations strictly follow Billing Confirmation Rules** — never skip
- **Sending emails always requires explicit user confirmation** of content and recipients
- When in doubt, **show information and let the user decide** rather than deciding for them

## Error Handling

For HTTP error codes, handling guidance, and RFC 7807 response format, see [api-reference.md §13](./references/api-reference.md#13-错误码速查表).

Key cases to handle gracefully:
- **401**: API Key invalid → guide re-configuration (see Authentication section)
- **402**: Insufficient credits → inform user and direct to [go.okki.ai/pricing](https://go.okki.ai/pricing)
- **403**: Free plan has no EDM access → guide user to upgrade

---

## Pricing

When users ask about plans, upgrades, or credit packs, direct them to the pricing page: [go.okki.ai/pricing](https://go.okki.ai/pricing)
